Description - Pune is the second largest city in the Indian state of Maharashtra and the seventh most populous city in the country. 
Situated 560 metres (1,837 feet) above sea level on the Deccan plateau on the right bank of the Mutha river, 
Pune is the administrative headquarters of Pune district and was once the centre of power of the Maratha Empire established by Shivaji Maharaj. 
In the 18th century, Pune was the political centre of the Indian subcontinent, as the seat of the Peshwas who were the prime ministers of the Maratha Empire.

Reason for choice - I have chosen this city because it is one of the places that I want to visit as many of my friends stay there.
